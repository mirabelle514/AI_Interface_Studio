## Design Philosophy

### Color System
- **Primary**: Parisian Navy (#22304A) - Trust, stability, primary text
- **Accent**: Sage Green (#A6B89A) - Success, positive feedback, interactions
- **Background**: Ivory White (#FAF8F3) - Clean, professional surfaces
- **Functional**: Antique Gold (#C6A664) - Warnings, progress indicators
- **Borders**: Dove Grey (#E5E2DD) - Subtle divisions and structure
- **Accents**: Burgundy (#7C3048) - Errors, critical states (borders only)

### Design Principles
- **Confidence-First Design**: Every AI output includes confidence indicators
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex information revealed hierarchically
- **Graceful Degradation**: Intelligent error handling with recovery options
- **Performance Awareness**: Real-time feedback for AI processing states
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliant with proper contrast ratios

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Router for navigation
- Lucide React for icons
- Vite for development and building

### Component Architecture
- Modular AI-specific components
- Reusable design system patterns
- Error boundary implementations
- Progressive enhancement strategies

### AI Interface Patterns
- **AIProcessingIndicator**: Real-time processing states with contextual messaging
- **ConfidenceScore**: Visual confidence indicators with trend analysis
- **InsightCard**: Contextual AI insights with actionable recommendations
- **ProgressiveDisclosure**: Hierarchical information architecture
- **ErrorBoundary**: Graceful error handling for AI service failures

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building

```bash
npm run build
```

## Design System Usage

### Confidence Thresholds
- High Confidence: â‰¥80% (Sage indicators)
- Medium Confidence: 60-79% (Gold indicators)  
- Low Confidence: <60% (Burgundy indicators)

### Loading States
- Always provide progress indicators when available
- Include contextual messaging for AI processing stages
- Use appropriate stage-specific icons and colors

### Error Handling
- Clear, actionable error messages
- Retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Graceful degradation for service unavailability

## AI/ML Interface Considerations

### Mental Models
- Users expect AI to be uncertain - embrace and communicate confidence levels
- Progressive disclosure prevents cognitive overload
- Clear feedback loops build trust in AI systems

### Trust Patterns
- Transparent confidence scoring
- Explainable AI outputs with reasoning
- Consistent error recovery mechanisms
- Performance metrics visibility

### Accessibility
- Screen reader compatible confidence indicators
- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- High contrast ratios maintained across all states
- Alternative text for data visualizations
